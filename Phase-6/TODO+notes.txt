1) FIX SEQUENCE: note that DBCommunicator always exists, but we only show him as active when it recieves/sends messages
2) ADD BUTTONS FUNCTIONALITY ON HOME PAGE
3) FIX CLASS DIAGRAM
4) ENRICH TEAM PLAN


NOTES:
1) known exceptions in Maria's Code: 
	-> observable lists can't read some attribute fields so we commented those out.
	-> cancelling file upload throws exception (ignore it).

2) I updated my sequence in phase 5 by accident and copied the new versions here. I'm sorry :(
